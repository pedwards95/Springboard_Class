//2. Var is function scope and let is block scope. Also, var is stored on the window as a variable.
// Also var is hoisted.

//3. Var is function scope and const is block scope. Also, var is stored on the window as a variable.
// Also var is hoisted. Const can not be changed. Const must be given a value at initialization.

//4. Const can not be changed. Const must be given a value at initialization.

//5. Hoisting is when the initialization of variables is done before the running of the rest of the code.
