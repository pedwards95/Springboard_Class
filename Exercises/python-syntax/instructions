Step One: Working in Python Files
    For all the syntax challenges, do your work in script files (Python files normally end with .py).
    We’ve provided a starter file for each of these with the problem statement and simple print-style tests already.

Step Two: Starting On Your Own
    Do this work in a new file, words.py.

    For a list of words, print out each word on a separate line, but in all uppercase.

    Turn that into a function, print_upper_words. Test it out. (Don’t forget to add a docstring to your function!)

    Change that function so that it only prints words that start with the letter ‘e’ (either upper or lowercase).

    Make your function more general: you should be able to pass in a set of letters, and it only prints words that start with one of those letters.

    For example:

    # this should print "HELLO", "HEY", "YO", and "YES"

    print_upper_words(["hello", "hey", "goodbye", "yo", "yes"],
                   must_start_with={"h", "y"})
