-- Design a schema for a simple sports league.
    -- All of the teams in the league
    -- All of the goals scored by every player for each game
    -- All of the players in the league and their corresponding teams
    -- All of the referees who have been part of each game
    -- All of the matches played between teams
    -- All of the start and end dates for season that a league has
    -- The standings/rankings of each team in the league (This doesnâ€™t have to be its own table if the data can be captured somehow).
