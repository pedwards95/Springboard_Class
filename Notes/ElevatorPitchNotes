My name is Paul Edwards, and I am a Full Stack Software Engineer.
In the most recent year, I have been expanding my reach into technologies through software and skill development bootcamps.
I am looking for a company where I can grow as a developer, and push into new technology ideas.
I am particularly interested in artificial intelligence, automation, and streamlining of online processes.
In the past I have received awards and praise for training, organization, and data handling, and I wish to continue in a software setting.
