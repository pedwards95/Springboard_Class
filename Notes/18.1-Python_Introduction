You’ll notice many objects provide a lot of methods that have names starting and ending with double-underscores
(Python programmers often call these “special methods” or “dunder [for ‘double-underscore’] methods”.

These aren’t methods you call directly (ie, you wouldn’t ever say mylist.__add__()) — instead, these work behind-the-scenes to support other operations of the object.

Generally, you can ignore them when examining an object.

help()
“Show me help about how to use this object”
