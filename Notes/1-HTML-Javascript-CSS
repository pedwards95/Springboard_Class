    Questions
        Why is the specificity of our selectors important?
            Specificity is the means by which browsers decide which CSS property values are the most relevant to an element and, therefore, will be applied.
            Specificity is based on the matching rules which are composed of different sorts of CSS selectors. Type selectors < Class selectors < ID selectors
        When to use a class selector and when to use id selector?
            The difference between an ID and a class is that an ID can be used to identify one element, whereas a class can be used to identify more than one.
